This is a simple game of checkers.

The essential file is checkers.js.  It can be included in any page with a canvas that has id='checkers' and dimensions of at least width=320 and height=350.

It uses the function roundedRect(...) in roundedRect.js, which is factored out because it is otherwise useful.

It also uses checker_click.wav for a sound effect.

The file checkers.php is a simple web page that includes the checkers game.  It is identical to the one hosted at my website at:
